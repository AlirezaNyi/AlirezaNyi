# Hi, I'm Alireza 👋

**Full-Stack & DevOps Engineer** with 7 years of experience building production-grade systems — from pixel-perfect frontends to distributed microservices running on Kubernetes.

I care about clean architecture, real-world performance, and code that other engineers can actually maintain.

## 🚀 What I Build

### Full-Stack Web Applications
End-to-end web products — React/Next.js on the frontend, Node.js or Go on the backend, PostgreSQL for data, Docker for deployment. I handle the full lifecycle from architecture to production.

### Microservices & Distributed Systems
Designed and shipped event-driven microservices using Kafka, deployed on Kubernetes with zero-downtime rollouts. I've migrated monoliths to microservices and built systems that scale without breaking.

### DevOps & Infrastructure
CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Kubernetes cluster setup (self-hosted and cloud), Prometheus + Grafana monitoring, and Docker-based environments that work the same in dev and production.

### AI & ML Integrations
Not just API wrappers — real ML pipelines, LLM integrations (OpenAI, Claude), document processing, data extraction, and recommendation systems. Python-based, production-deployed, monitored.

## 📈 By the Numbers

- **7 years** of professional software development
- **3 architectural domains:** Web, DevOps, ML/AI
- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Python, C#
- **Available for:** Remote contracts, async-friendly, timezone flexible

## 🧠 How I Work

- I read the requirements carefully before writing a single line of code
- I communicate daily with async updates — no need to chase me
- I deliver clean, documented code your team can maintain after I'm gone
- I think about edge cases, security, and scalability — not just the happy path
- I'm comfortable working independently or as part of a distributed team
